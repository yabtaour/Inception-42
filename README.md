# Inception-42

Overview
This project uses Docker containers to create an infrastructure for WordPress. The infrastructure consists of Nginx, WordPress and PHP-FPM, and MariaDB. It also includes Redis, FTP, Adminer, cAdvisor, and a simple static page, each service in their own container. The containers are built using Dockerfiles based on Debian, and Docker Compose is used to manage the containers.
